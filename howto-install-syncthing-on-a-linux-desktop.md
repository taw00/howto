# HowTo Install Syncthing on a Linux Desktop

## Let's do it!

Getting Syncthing up and running on a linux desktop is SUPER pain free.

0. **Login to your desktop as a normal user**

1. **Install `syncthing` and `firewalld` and the _Syncthing Tray_ system tray utility**

```bash
sudo dnf install syncthing firewalld -y
flatpak install io.github.martchus.syncthingtray -y
```

2. **Configure `firewalld` to allow communication with the `syncthing` service**

For more expansive info about firewalld (and fails2ban):
<https://github.com/taw00/howto/blob/master/howto-configure-firewalld-and-fail2ban-for-linux.md>

```bash
# Turn on and enable firewalld if not already done...
sudo firewall-cmd --state
sudo systemctl start firewalld.service
sudo systemctl enable firewalld.service

# If you had custom zoning set, remember to add --zone=<yourzonelabel> to the
# configuration commands, though if the zone is configured to be the default,
# things should "just work"
sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
#sudo firewall-cmd --zone=<yourzonelabel> --list-all
#sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

# allow the syncthing service, but DO NOT allow the GUI service to be exposed
# to the internet. You don't need that added exposure.
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=syncthing --permanent
#sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=syncthing-gui --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```


3. **Enable the `syncthing` service and start it up**

```bash
syncthing --user enable syncthing.service
syncthing --user start syncthing.service
```

Configuration and whatnot will, by default, live in
`$HOME/.local/state/syncthing/`

4. **Browse to <http:127.0.0.1:8384> and configure your instance**

Read the docs! <https://docs.syncthing.net/> Once you have a set username and
password and you are happy with your setup …

5. **Run the Syncthing Tray application**

In your desktop interface, find the _Syncthing Tray_ application, and run it.
Select these options in the wizard that will pop up …

- Start guided setup
- Configure Syncthing Tray for currently running Syncthing instance
- Next
- Apply
- Copy that ID somewhere (it's also in the webui)
- Finish

Done. You should now see a little Syncthing icon in your system tray if you
have that enabled. If you don't see it, you may have to enable the visibility
of system tray icons. On GNOME, you do that with the
[AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)
GNOME Extension. I recommend installing that. Note that you may have to use
Firefox to install extensions. I don't know. That is beyond the scope of this
document.

If you screw up the Syncthing Tray set up, just click the tray icon, choose
`Settings` and click the little wizard wand in the upper right hand corner of
the window to repeat the steps above.

FYI. The Syncthing Tray application is only useful as an service-wellness
barometer. Otherwise it doesn't do much. You can also kick open the webUI with
it as well. The color will be green if the `syncthing` service is running okay
and it will some other color if something seems to be amiss.

6. Configure Syncthing Tray to autostart upon login

Assumption: you are running the GNOME desktop. If not, then, figure it out. :)

Either,
- install the _Gnome Tweaks_ application
- open it
- choose "Startup Applications"
- add _Syncthing Tray_ to the list of applications
Or, assuming you installed Syncthing Tray as a Flatpak application,
- copy Syncthing Tray's `.desktop` file into the `.config/autostart` folder  
  `cp /var/lib/flatpak/app/io.github.martchus.syncthingtray/current/active/export/share/applications/io.github.martchus.syncthingtray.desktop .config/autostart/`

&nbsp;

Done! Now follow the docs for using the service: https://docs.syncthing.net/
Set Syncthing up on all of your systems and share files and documents between
them.

## Good luck!
